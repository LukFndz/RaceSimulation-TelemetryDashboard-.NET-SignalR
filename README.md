# 🏎️ F1 Telemetry Dashboard

Real-time F1-style telemetry dashboard + configurable race simulator built with C#, .NET 8, SignalR, and Chart.js.

On realgps-calculate-telemetry branch, i calculate the telemetry by last year GPs data based on FastF1 API

# 🚀 Features
# 📡 Real-time Telemetry
Speed, RPM, Gear
Throttle / Brake
Fuel
DRS
Tire temperatures

📊 Professional Charts
Real-time updates
Historical data from SQLite
Separate charts: Speed, RPM, Throttle, Brake, Fuel, Tires

# 🏁 Race Simulation
Live progress Based on FastF1 API


# 🧱 Architecture
Telemetry.Api – Web API + SignalR (controllers)
Telemetry.Application – DTOs, service interfaces
Telemetry.Infrastructure – EF Core, repositories, SignalR service, race simulator
Telemetry.Domain – Pure models & enums
Tech: Clean Architecture, EF Core + SQLite, SignalR

# 🖥️ Web Dashboard
Pit wall-style layout
Real-time & historical charts
CSS animations
Auto-lock buttons based on race state

# ▶️ Getting Started
# Restore packages

# 🏎️ Using the Simulator
Enter lap count
Click Start Race
Stop anytime with Stop Race
Graphs update in real-time
Reload page without losing state

Backend: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, SignalR, EF Core + SQLite, Clean Architecture, FastF1 API (Python)
